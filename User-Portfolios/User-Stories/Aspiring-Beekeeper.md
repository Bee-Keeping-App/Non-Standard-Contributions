Aspiring Beekeeper – The Curious Newcomer

“I am someone who doesn’t keep bees yet, but I’ve always been fascinated by them. I need a clear, beginner-friendly way to learn the basics and plan for my first hive, so that I can start my beekeeping journey without feeling overwhelmed.”

    Motivation: 
    
        Fascinated by nature, pollinators, and the idea of producing their own honey. Maybe inspired by seeing friends keep bees or attending a local club meeting. They’re not sure yet if they’re ready to commit.

    Behavior & Preferences: 
    
        Browses online forums, watches YouTube, maybe follows beekeepers on Instagram. Feels intimidated by the amount of information and disagreement among beekeepers. Doesn’t want to buy equipment or bees until they understand what’s involved.

    Key Needs:

        Educational mode: A beginner-friendly section of the app with plain-language guides, seasonal timelines, and equipment checklists.

        Simulated hive tracking: The ability to “practice” by following a sample hive in the app before owning one.

        Community connection: Access to beekeeper Q&A, local club info, or mentor matching so they don’t feel alone starting out.

        Gentle onboarding: Clear explanations of terms (“What’s brood?”, “What’s a super?”) and interactive tutorials that make the learning approachable.
