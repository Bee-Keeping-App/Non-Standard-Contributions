Intermediate Hobbyist – Busy, Hands‑On Organizer

“I have a few years of beekeeping under my belt and about half a dozen hives. I need a more efficient way to record and recall hive data – something I can use with gloves on – so that I don’t lose track of important tasks as my apiary grows.”

    Experience & Motivation: 
        
        4–10 years experience, managing around 5–10 hives. A dedicated hobbyist (and budding sideliner) interested in honey production and healthy colonies. He’s busy with work/family, so efficiency is key. Past mistakes (like missing a mite treatment window) have made him determined to improve record-keeping.

    Behavior & Preferences: 
        
        Currently uses a mix of methods – a notebook or spreadsheet updated after inspections – and has tried one or two beekeeping apps. He found previous apps “clunky” to use in the field with PPE on】, so he often ends up scribbling notes on paper and transcribing later. He’s moderately tech-comfortable and willing to use tools that save time. He doesn’t need frills; he values practical features that streamline hive management.`

    Key Needs:

        Hands-free data entry: A top priority is the ability to log hive data without removing gloves. He wants voice-to-text input for recording notes or numbers during inspections. For example, he’d like to say “Hive 3 – queen seen, 2 swarm cells, added super” and have the app record that. This solves the glove problem and speeds up his workflow.

        Quick, minimal-touch interface: When he does need to use the screen, it should require minimal taps. Large buttons, auto-fill of date/time, and efficient menus (e.g. one-tap to add a common note) are crucial. He appreciates features like auto-dated entries and templates for common actions to reduce typing.

        Reminders & to-do lists: With multiple hives, he finds it hard to remember what each needs next. He wants the app to generate reminders for follow-ups – e.g. “Check Hive 2 for queen laying in 14 days” after making a split. Calendar alerts for seasonal tasks (treat for mites, harvest honey, winterize, etc.) would prevent oversights. This helps avoid repeats of past issues, such as forgetting a re-queen check and ending up with a lost colony.

        Hive-by-hive records: He needs to quickly review each hive’s history on the spot. The app should let him pull up Hive X and see recent inspections, treatments, and notes at a glance. This way, if something seems off, he can instantly recall what happened in that hive (e.g. “Did I treat this hive already?”). A search or filter by hive or date feature would be useful to find specific info.

        Data syncing & backup: He often has spotty internet at the apiary, so offline capability with later syncing is important. He’d also like to enter detailed notes or review data on his computer at home. Seamless sync between a phone (field use) and a desktop interface would fit his workflow.

        Intermediate analytics: While he prefers to “keep it simple” during inspections, he’s interested in basic charts or summaries later on. For instance, seeing a graph of each hive’s honey yield or brood count over the season, or trendlines of mite counts, would help him make decisions – but these should be auto-generated from his data (since he won’t input data twice). He’s tech-savvy enough to appreciate trends, as long as the app crunches it without much extra effort on his part.

        Community insight: He informally shares records with a few beekeeper friends and is curious about others’ practices. A feature to compare notes or see aggregated stats (like average local mite counts or honey harvests) could be motivating. He’d also welcome a FAQ or tips section in the app for quick answers (e.g. “When should I start spring feeding in my region?”).
