Commercial Beekeeper – Scale‑Focused Operator

“I run a bee business with many hives. I need a system that streamlines hive inspections and scheduling at scale, so I can keep on top of hundreds of tasks and maximize my honey production without missing a beat.”

    Experience & Motivation: 
    
        5+ years of beekeeping, operating in a commercial capacity – e.g. honey production, pollination services, or bee sales. Manages 50+ hives across multiple yards. Very outcome-driven: productivity and colony health are bottom-line. Time is money, and efficiency is crucial to prevent losses (a lost queen or a missed disease can mean significant financial hit).

    Behavior & Preferences: 
    
        Uses quick and practical record methods. Often notes are kept on hive lids, notecards, or spreadsheets – minimal writing per hive because of time constraints. Might have tried software like HiveTracks but abandoned it if it slowed down work (some cited taking gloves off as a deal-breaker). This user is not averse to tech – they often use **vehicles, loaders, pallet scales, etc. – but any app must integrate into the fast pace of commercial ops. They may manage a team, so data sharing and consistency are important (everyone needs the same hive info).

    Key Needs:

        Fast, hands-free logging: Speed is the top priority. The app must enable rapid data entry for each hive during yard visits. Voice-to-text is highly desired – e.g. speaking a checklist while inspecting 20 hives in a row. Scannable codes on hives were even suggested (scan a barcode on the hive to bring up its record without typing). The goal is no pen, no removing gloves – just quick capture of key metrics (like “Hive A: queen OK, 5 frames brood, added super, treated mites”) in seconds. If the app can’t be used efficiently with gloves and quick motions, it won’t be adopted in this context.

        Aggregated hive management: Needs a dashboard view of the entire operation. For example, a screen that shows all yards/hives with status indicators (which need feeding, which had queen issues, which are due for inspection). The app should support per-hive histories and also roll-up views. A feature to generate to-do lists across hives is essential – e.g. “This week: 10 hives due for mite check, 5 hives ready to harvest.” One commercial keeper imagined an app that links hive histories and creates a “to-do” list automatically based on last actions.

        Key data tracking: Emphasis on recording business-critical info: treatments (what/when), feedings, honey supers added/removed, queen status/age, and hive strength. The app should make it easy to log these specifics and later search or filter by them. For instance, they might need to quickly find “all hives where the queen is over 2 years old” or get an alert when a queen is due for replacement. One respondent highlighted queen age/lineage reminders as crucial. Being able to track lineage and requeening is valuable not only to hobbyists but also to commercial beekeepers selecting for performance.

        Reminders & scheduling: With so many hives, automated reminders are life-savers. The app should calculate and remind of recurring tasks: treatments due (e.g. 10 days after last treatment), upcoming queen cell checks (e.g. “queen cell in Hive 12 is due to hatch – don’t disturb!”), or seasonal prep (like “Time to winterize in your region”). This prevents costly mistakes. For example, one commercial user admitted forgetting a developing queen cell and damaging it, setting that colony back a month. A proactive alert could prevent such losses.

        Scalability and multi-user: The app must handle dozens of hives seamlessly. That means efficient data sync and possibly multi-user support – if the beekeeper has helpers, everyone should be able to input and view data for the same operation. Cloud syncing across devices (phones/tablets used by field workers and a computer in the office) ensures the data is up-to-date. Also, the app should be robust – able to store years of data for lots of hives without slowdowns.

        Integration with business tools: Useful if the app can export data to or integrate with business software (inventory, sales, accounting). For instance, exporting honey harvest records or queen production records for regulatory or sales tracking. While not the core use, this makes the app more valuable to a commercial user who otherwise might use separate systems.

        Benchmarking and community: Commercial beekeepers often share info informally and want to know industry benchmarks. The app could provide aggregate comparisons (anonymously) – e.g. average honey yield in the area, or common hive loss causes other users log. This is “nice-to-have,” but it could help identify improvement areas and validate practices. One commercial keeper noted that knowing what info others track and learning “other ways” of doing things would be helpful. In-app tips gleaned from community data (like “90% of users in your region treated for mites this week”) could inform his decisions.
