Low Tech Beginner Hobbyist

“I am a new beekeeper who trusts my notebook more than apps. I need a very simple and intuitive tool(if I use one at all) so that I can replace my paper notes without struggling with technology.”

    Experience & Motivation: 0–3 years experience, 1–2 hives. Keeps bees as a hobby, mainly for the enjoyment and garden pollination benefits. He’s curious but cautious with new tech.

    Behavior & Preferences: Uses a paper journal or writes notes on hive covers to record inspections. Unfamiliar with beekeeping apps (didn’t even know they existed) and thus far “old-school.” He finds comfort in pen-and-paper and is hesitant to adopt digital tools that might complicate his routine. Advanced features like graphs or AI feel unnecessary – he prefers to keep things straightforward.

    Key Needs:

    Ease of use over features: The app must be easier than pen and paper to win him over. This means a clean, intuitive interface with minimal navigation steps. If logging a note in the app takes more taps or time than jotting in him notebook, he won’t use it.

    Basic record-keeping: He primarily needs simple notes and date tracking – hive visits, feeding, treatments – without extra complexity. Fancy analytics or dense menus would overwhelm him, so a “basic mode” for just text notes and reminders is ideal.

    Low-tech accessibility: Since he isn’t very tech-savvy, features like automatic data save (to avoid losing notes) and maybe the option to print records would reassure him. He values reliability; for instance, he worries about losing electronic files more than paper. Offline functionality is important if he doesn’t always use mobile data.

    Optional advanced features: He is skeptical of AI or complex analytics. He wouldn’t trust an AI’s answer at face value for critical decisions. Thus, any advanced features (charts, AI advice) should be optional and unobtrusive. As he gains experience, he might explore them, but initially the app should not force these on him.

    Transition support: To ease the shift from paper, the app could allow importing photos of him notebook or provide a gentle onboarding. Essentially, it should feel like a digital extension of him notebook, not a complicated new system.
