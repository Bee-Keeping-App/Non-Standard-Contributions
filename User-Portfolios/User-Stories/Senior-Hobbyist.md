Senior Hobbyist – Accessibility‑Focused Caretaker

“I’m an older beekeeper who isn’t as able as I used to be. I need an app that accommodates my physical limitations and keeps things simple, so I can continue enjoying my bees without frustration.”

    Experience & Motivation: 
    
        30+ years of beekeeping (now in retirement years). Manages a small number of hives (e.g. 2–5) for enjoyment, pollination, and personal honey. Bees are a relaxing passion for her – as she says, “it’s not stressful; that’s why I keep bees”. She wants to keep at it as long as possible, despite some mobility or sensory challenges that come with age.

    Behavior & Preferences: 
    
        Still uses a notebook or memory for records, but is open to some technology if it clearly helps. She might have a smartphone or tablet primarily for communication (with children or grandkids) and is willing to use apps if they’re truly user-friendly. However, any sign of complexity or tiny text will turn her off. In the bee yard, tasks like lifting heavy boxes are hard – she often enlists help for that. She may not use a phone while handling bees unless it’s exceptionally easy, because juggling too many things can be unsafe for her.

    Key Needs:

        Accessible UI design: The app must have large, clear text and buttons for easy readability. She likely has bifocals and thick gloves; a fiddly interface is a non-starter. High contrast colors and an option for voice feedback (the app reading out confirmations) would be beneficial. Essentially, an “accessibility mode” with bigger interface elements would empower her to use the app confidently. One user explicitly requested “big buttons on display so it can be used with gloves on” – a need that aligns perfectly here.

        Hands-free and minimal typing: Given arthritis or shaky hands, she prefers speaking to typing. Voice notes and voice commands are important – she could dictate an inspection note or ask the app to “remind me to check Hive B in two weeks.” If she can simply talk instead of tapping tiny keys, she’ll use the app more often. This also keeps her focus on the bees rather than fiddling with a device.

        Reduced physical interaction: She worries about handling a phone with sticky gloves (fear of dropping it or getting it dirty). She has thought of solutions like touchscreen-compatible gloves or a protective screen cover to keep the phone clean. The app should ideally require only one hand (or voice) to operate, so she can keep one hand on the hive. Features like auto-save (no need to hit small “Save” buttons) and shake-proof input (so if her hand trembles, it won’t trigger the wrong action) are important subtle considerations.

        Cross-device syncing: At home, she would prefer reviewing her notes on a larger screen (like a tablet or computer) where she’s more comfortable reading. The app should sync data so she can enter minimal info in the field, then later perhaps expand on it from her desktop if needed. This flexibility means she’s not forced to do everything on a tiny phone screen.

        Simple reminders: Memory isn’t as sharp as before, so gentle notifications for tasks (feeding, inspections, medication timings) are very helpful. She would set up basic alerts like “October: prepare for winter” or “May 1: check for swarm cells,” which the app would then display or send via email/text. These prompts give her peace of mind that important seasonal chores won’t be forgotten.

        Health and safety features: As an older beekeeper, she’s mindful of health. While not a standard app feature, she mused it’d be nice if the app could help with safety, like logging any allergic reaction incidents or even alerting a contact if she doesn’t check in after an inspection (since she often works alone). This isn’t a requirement from the survey, but it’s an example of forward-looking accessibility consideration.

        Educational support: She’s still learning new things and might appreciate refresher prompts. For example, if the app knows she hasn’t inspected in a while, a notification like “It’s been 4 weeks – consider checking your hives” would nudge her gently. Also, since lifting is an issue, the app could recommend best practices (like using nuc boxes or asking a friend during heavy honey harvests). Having a bit of contextual advice tailored to an older beekeeper’s needs (such as ergonomic tips or connecting with local youth beekeepers for assistance) could extend her beekeeping hobby comfortably.
