Expert Hobbyist – Old‑School Minimalist (Tech Skeptic)

“I am a beekeeper with decades of experience. I need a tool that augments my memory and record-keeping without getting in my way, so I can maintain my hives’ history and spot patterns while still doing things the way I like.”

    Experience & Motivation: 
    
        10+ years (an “old hand”), managing a dozen or more hives over the years. Keeps bees primarily for the love of beekeeping – enjoys the process, the honey, and mentoring newcomers. She values methods that are proven by experience.

    Behavior & Preferences: 
    
        Maintains a detailed paper log (e.g. a binder with a section per colony) and sometimes an Excel sheet for year-end tallies. In the bee yard, she often works from memory and jots notes after inspections to avoid bringing gadgets near sticky honey and propolis. She dislikes using smartphones in the apiary – gloves and bee suits make it impractical, and she’s had incidents like nearly dropping her phone in a hive. She is comfortable with her analog system and is cautious about adopting new tech, having seen many fads come and go.

    Key Needs:

        Non-intrusive design: Any app for her must be simple, clear, and unobtrusive. She expects a straightforward interface that doesn’t require a lot of tapping or navigating for basic tasks. Ideally, the app’s default mode would be a “simple interface” showing core info, with any advanced features hidden unless needed. This respects her desire to focus on the bees, not the screen.

        Respect for analog workflow: She wants to seamlessly transition from paper to digital. For example, she’d love to have all her past notes digitized in one place for easy search, but she’s not about to type years of data manually. The app could allow importing notes or provide a quick way to log entries after an inspection (when she’s out of the field). Crucially, it should work offline in case she chooses to use a tablet in the yard – no reliance on cell signal deep in her rural bee yard.

        Glove-friendly and durable: If she does use the app in the field, it needs to accommodate her protective gear. Large buttons and text are a must for readability and tapping with gloves. She might use a stylus or a tablet with a shoulder strap, so the design should be responsive and clear even on a bigger screen. She’s even considered touchscreen-compatible gloves and a phone cover to keep things from getting sticky, so the app should at least not require precision tapping or swiping.

        Complete hive history: With many colonies over many years, she wants the ability to track each hive’s history (requeening dates, disease incidents, production, etc.). Her memory is strong but not infallible – she admits to instances of lost info, like missing a queenless situation until it was too late. The app should serve as a memory aid, helping her avoid mistakes by having all prior records at her fingertips. For example, if a hive has a recurring issue, she could quickly see past notes and treatments.

        Long-term trend analysis: She’s interested in big-picture insights that are hard to get from scattered notebooks. Being able to, say, compare winter survival rates or honey yields across years (in a chart or summary) would be valuable. She also tracks traits like queen lineage and colony temperament. A feature to view trends or patterns over seasons (e.g. how a particular queen’s offspring performed) would appeal to her analytical side – as long as inputting that data isn’t a chore.

        Selective adoption of tech: She is skeptical of AI and “black box” solutions. She won’t trust automated advice blindly (“AI doesn’t always give the right answer, and I won’t risk my hives on it”). However, she is not entirely opposed to technology that clearly helps. For instance, she sees value in image recognition for mite counts or disease signs as a double-check, but would treat it as a second opinion. The app should allow her to verify any AI-generated suggestion with her own judgment.

        Mentorship and sharing: As a community mentor, she occasionally shares her methods with new beekeepers. She would use the app to export or show records as teaching examples. A mode to share read-only hive reports (without exposing all her data) might encourage even this traditionalist to engage with the digital tool, as it could help educate others.
