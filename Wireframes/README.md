# Wireframes

This folder contains early design wireframes, sketches, and low-fidelity design concepts.

## What Goes Here
- Low-fidelity wireframes and sketches
- User flow diagrams
- Information architecture diagrams
- Hand-drawn sketches and concepts
- Early digital wireframes
- Site maps and navigation structures

## File Organization
- Organize by feature or user flow
- Include both individual screens and complete flows
- Use version numbers for iterations
- Keep hand-drawn sketches in a separate subfolder

## Guidelines
- Include context about the design thinking behind each wireframe
- Show progression from early concepts to refined wireframes
- Reference related high-fidelity designs in other folders
- Include annotations explaining functionality and interactions
- Document any assumptions or constraints
