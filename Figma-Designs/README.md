# Figma Designs

This folder contains Figma files, exports, and design system materials created during the design process.

## What Goes Here
- Figma file exports (.fig files when possible)
- High-fidelity mockups and designs
- Design system components and style guides
- Interactive prototype exports from Figma
- Design iterations and version history
- Color palettes and typography specifications

## File Organization
- Create subfolders by feature, screen, or design phase
- Use version numbers for design iterations (v1, v2, etc.)
- Include both editable files and static exports (PNG, PDF)
- Name files descriptively: `feature-name_version_YYYY-MM-DD`

## Guidelines
- Include links to live Figma files when sharing access is appropriate
- Export key screens in multiple formats for accessibility
- Document design decisions and rationale
- Reference related wireframes or prototypes in other folders
