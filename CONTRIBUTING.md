# Contributing to Non-Standard-Contributions Vault

Thank you for contributing to our design vault! This repository serves as an organized archive for all non-code design materials and research.

## üéØ Before You Contribute

1. **Choose the Right Folder**: Review the main README.md to understand which folder best fits your contribution
2. **Read Folder Guidelines**: Each folder has its own README with specific organization guidelines
3. **Check Existing Materials**: Look for similar materials to understand the current organization pattern
4. **Prepare Your Materials**: Ensure files are properly named and organized

## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### File Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive, meaningful names
- Include dates in YYYY-MM-DD format when relevant
- Use hyphens or underscores instead of spaces
- Include version numbers for iterations (v1, v2, etc.)

### Privacy and Ethics
- **Anonymize all personal data** before uploading
- Remove or redact any sensitive information
- Ensure compliance with privacy regulations
- Include appropriate disclaimers for user research data

### Organization Standards
- Create subfolders when you have multiple related files
- Include context documentation (README files in subfolders)
- Cross-reference related materials in other folders
- Maintain consistent structure within each folder

### File Formats
- Prefer open, accessible formats when possible
- Include multiple formats for key materials (e.g., PDF + source file)
- Optimize file sizes for repository storage
- Include source files when available

## üîÑ Contribution Process

1. **Organize Your Materials**: Sort files into appropriate folders
2. **Follow Naming Conventions**: Use consistent, descriptive file names
3. **Add Documentation**: Include context and explanation
4. **Update READMEs**: Add descriptions to folder READMEs if needed
5. **Cross-Reference**: Link to related materials in other folders

## üìÅ Folder-Specific Guidelines

- Include device/browser context in filenames
- Add annotations when helpful

### Research/
- Include executive summaries for large documents
- Document research objectives and methodology
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations

### Wireframes/
- Show progression from concept to refined design
- Include user flow context
- Reference related high-fidelity designs

### Prototypes/
- Include instructions for viewing/running prototypes
- Document technical requirements
- Provide hosted links when available

### Assets/
- Include licensing and attribution information
- Provide multiple formats (SVG, PNG, etc.)
- Organize by asset type and usage context

## ‚ùì Questions?

If you're unsure about where to place materials or how to organize them:

1. Check the README in the most relevant folder
2. Look at existing examples in that folder
3. When in doubt, include more documentation rather than less
4. Consider creating a subfolder with its own README for complex contributions

## üöÄ Quality Standards

- **Complete**: Include all necessary context and documentation
- **Organized**: Follow established folder and naming conventions
- **Accessible**: Use formats that others can easily view and understand
- **Privacy-Compliant**: Ensure all personal data is properly anonymized
- **Cross-Referenced**: Link to related materials when relevant

Remember: Every contribution helps build a comprehensive record of our design thinking and research process. Thank you for taking the time to organize and document your materials properly!
